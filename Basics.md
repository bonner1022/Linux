# Getting Started with Linux Terminal 

## Project Objective
This project gives us experience using Linux commands to perform the following tasks.
- Interact with the Linux terminal
- Browse directories on a Linux filesystem using the ls command
- Navigate directories using the cd command
- Save time and effort by using tab completion and your command history

## Tasks
### Viewing files in the current working directory
We are currently in a directory named 'Linux' which holds all Linux files that we have in our user profile and we use `ls` to view this directory.

### Viewing files and directories within any directory
We use `ls /bin` to view all files in the /bin directory

### Navigating directories
While in the Linux directory, we use `cd ~` to navigate to the home directory.
We use `cd ..` to navigate to the parent directory of the home directory and then
we also use `cd /` to navigate to the root directory of the machine. We use `ls` at each step to verify the results.

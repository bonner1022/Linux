# Getting Started with Linux Terminal 

## Project Objective
This project gives us experience using Linux commands to perform the following tasks.
- Interact with the Linux terminal
- Browse directories on a Linux filesystem using the ls command
- Navigate directories using the cd command
- Save time and effort by using tab completion and your command history

## Tasks
### Viewing files in the current working directory
We are in the directory for Linux files on our local machine which is a user profile

`ls`

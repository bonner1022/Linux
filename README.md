# Linux
We show the ability to use Linux commands in the terminal to communicate with the Shell to navigate the filesystem, display directory/file contents and file path. 

We use Linux to perform some fundamental system administation operations, like using `apt` for installing and updating packages. We also use Linux to open text editors, enter text and save files, and also using Bash to interpret Linux commands in txt files.

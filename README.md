# Linux
We show the ability to use fundamentals of Linux, using commands in the terminal to communicate with the Shell to navigate the filesystem, display directory and file contents and the absolute and relative file paths of corresponding files, in **_Basics.md_**. We show how to use Linux to perform some fundamental system administation operations, like using `apt` for installing and updating packages. We also display how to utilize Linux to open text editors for the purpose of creating and saving text files, and using a _Bash_ command to interpret Linux commands in txt files. This is displayed in **_TextEditors.md_** We display the basic use of informational commands to display system information, the users associated with the system and information of processes running on the system in **_InfoCmds.md_**.
